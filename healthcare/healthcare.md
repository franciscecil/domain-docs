# Health Care

## MEDICARE:

In the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States"), Medicare is a national health insurance program, now administered by the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services of the [U.S. federal government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Medicare_and_Medicaid_Services "Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services") but begun in 1966 under the Social Security Administration. United States Medicare is funded by a combination of a [payroll tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payroll_tax "Payroll tax"), premiums and surtaxes from [beneficiaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_(United_States)#Eligibility), and general revenue. It provides [health insurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance "Health insurance") for Americans [aged 65 and older](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age "Old age") who have worked and paid into the system through the payroll tax.

Medicare is further divided into parts A and B—

 1. Medicare Part A covers hospital (inpatient, formally admitted only),
    skilled nursing (only after being formally admitted for three days
    and not for custodial care), and hospice services.
    
    
 2. Medicare Part B covers outpatient services including some providers
    services while inpatient at a hospital. Part D covers
    self-administered prescription drugs

**MEDICAID:**

Medicaid in the United States is a joint federal and state program that helps with medical costs for some people with limited income and resources. Medicaid also offers benefits not normally covered by Medicare, like nursing home care and personal care services. The Health Insurance Association of America describes Medicaid as a "government insurance program for persons of all ages whose income and resources are insufficient to pay for health care".[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid#cite_note-1) Medicaid is the largest source of funding for medical and health-related services for people with low income in the United States, providing free health insurance to over 74 million low-income and disabled people.

**COMMERCIAL:**

Commercial insurance providers are for-profit companies, although some operate as nonprofit organizations. Policyholders’ monthly premiums fund commercial policies. Their premiums and coverage amounts are designed to create a profit for the insurance company. If your healthcare policy is not part of one of the aforementioned government programs, it is a commercial health insurance policy. Employer-provided group health insurance policies are commercial, as are individual policies people can buy if they do not receive employer or government insurance benefits.

**Key Concepts:**

**HMO**:

HMO means "Health Maintenance Organization." HMO plans offer a wide range of healthcare services through a network of providers who agree to supply services to members. With an HMO you'll likely have coverage for a broader range of preventive healthcare services than you would through another type of plan.

As a member of an HMO, a person will be required to choose a primary care physician (PCP). Your PCP will take care of most of your healthcare needs. Before a member can see a specialist, they’ll need to obtain a referral from their PCP.

Though there are many variations, HMO plans typically enable members to have lower out-of-pocket healthcare expenses. They may not be required to pay a deductible before coverage starts and co-payments will likely be minimal. The members also typically won't have to submit any of your own claims to the insurance company.

**PPO**:

PPO plans, or "Preferred Provider Organization" plans, are one of the most popular types of plans in the Individual and Family market. PPO plans allow you to visit whatever in-network physician or healthcare provider you wish without first requiring a referral from a primary care physician.

As a member of a PPO plan, you'll be encouraged to use the insurance company's network of preferred doctors and you usually won't need to choose a primary care physician. No matter which healthcare provider you choose, in-network healthcare services will be covered at a higher benefit level than out-of-network services. It's important to check if you provider accepts your health plan so you receive the highest level of benefit coverage.

You will probably have an annual deductible to pay before the insurance company starts covering your medical bills.

**POS**:

A point of service plan, is a type of [managed care](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Managed_care "Managed care")  [health insurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance "Health insurance") plan in the United States. It combines characteristics of the [health maintenance organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_maintenance_organization "Health maintenance organization") (HMO) and the [preferred provider organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferred_provider_organization "Preferred provider organization") (PPO).

The [POS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_sale "Point of sale") is based on a managed care foundation—lower medical costs in exchange for more limited choice. But POS health insurance does differ from other managed care plans.

Enrollees in a POS plan are required to choose a primary care physician from within the health care network; this PCP becomes their "point of service". The PCP may make referrals outside the network, but with lesser compensation offered by the patient's health insurance company. For medical visits within the health care network, paperwork is usually completed for the patient. If the patient chooses to go outside the network, it is the patient's responsibility to fill out forms, send bills in for payment, and keep an accurate account of health care receipts.
