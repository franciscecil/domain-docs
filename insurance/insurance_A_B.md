## A 


**ability to pay**

A policy with the appropriate coverage at a high enough level to pay a claim against it has the ability to pay. ClaimCenter 
checks the coverage limits on the policy before setting or increasing reserves, or before making any new payment. This 
ensures that the policy has the ability to pay the entire reserve amount or that the sum of payments does not exceed the coverage 
limit on the policy. 

**abort** 

A failure of a message that is one of several messages in an external operation, which causes the other messages in the external 
operation to be skipped. 

**account** 

(1) In PolicyCenter and BillingCenter, a higher level construct that logically groups multiple policies under a person or a company, 
under one entity, Account. For example, Acme Company account can include workers’ compensation and general liability 
policies, or a person can have both personal auto and homeowners policies. By tying both policies to the same account, the 
system tracks all of the business that the carrier has with a single insured. (2) Also in BillingCenter, an accounting record that 
accumulates the results of transactions. It shows increases, decreases, and a balance. See T-account. 

**account current** 

An agency bill process that allows the producer to determine the due dates and the amounts to be paid. The producer is not sent 
a monthly statement, but instead submits a promise to pay to the policy holder. This document lists the expected net amounts 
and the gross amount minus the commission amount. The promise to pay identifies the amount the producer expects to pay 
each month. If there is a discrepancy, BillingCenter generates an exception. 

**account evaluation** 

A process that automatically generates a rating of Poor, Marginal, Acceptable, Good, Excellent, or New Account for an 
account. BillingCenter bases the rating on certain criteria such as the number of delinquencies, perjorative payments or insufficient 
funds events, or policy cancellations. The carrier can use the account evaluation rating to help determine whether to 
renew the policy. 

**accounting year** 

Treaties that operate on an accounting year basis include all transactions that take place during the accounting year of the 
treaty, regardless of the underwriting year to which they relate. 

**accounts payable** 

Money that an insured owes to a carrier for products and services purchased on credit. This item appears on the insured’s balance 
sheet as a current liability, as the expectation is that the liability must be fulfilled in less than a year. If you pay off 
accounts payable amounts, then it represents a negative cash flow for the company. 

**accounts receivable** 

Money that an insured owes a carrier for products and services provided on credit. BillingCenter treats this money as a current 
asset on a balance sheet. BillingCenter generally treats a specific service as an account receivable only after it sends the 
insured an invoice. 

**acknowledgement** 

A message back to a Guidewire application indicating whether the message was successfully sent. This can be a positive 
acknowledgement (ack) indicating that the external system processed the message. Or, it can also be a negative acknowledgement 
(nack) indicating that the external system did not handle the message properly because of some error. 

**ACH** 

Automated clearing house. An electronic network of financial transactions in the United States that processes large volumes of 
both credit and debit transactions, which are originated in batches. 

**ACR** 

Additional Case Reserves 

**action handler** 

A parameter passed with HTTP data extraction requests. Action handlers specified in the URL do two things: provide different 
extraction results, and provides the template with a different root object, or in some cases multiple root objects. For example, 
the ViewClaim action handler finds a specific claim then passes it to a template with the claim as the root object with the Gosu 
symbol claim. 

**active policy** 

A policy that has not been canceled, not taken, expired, or non-renewed. 

**activity pattern** 

A template that standardizes the way Guidewire applications generate activities. Both Gosu classes and ClaimCenter create 
activities based on activity patterns. Each pattern describes one kind of activity that might be needed in handling the policy or 
account process. Activity patterns contain many default, or typical, characteristics for each activity, such as its name, its relative 
priority, and whether or not it is mandatory. When you create an activity, Guidewire applications use the pattern as a template 
to set the default values for the activity, such as Subject and Priority. You can override these defaults. 

**adapter** 

The obsolete name used for a special type of plugin that Guidewire no longer supports. Some plugin interfaces have adapter in 
the name for historical reasons. However, this merely indicate that the object is a plugin interface. 

**addendum** 

A document recording an alteration to a reinsurance contract. 

**additional insured** 

A person or entity, other than the named insured, who the policy also affords some protection. The additional insured’s protection 
is limited to liability incurred by the specific role they occupy in relation to the named insured. For example, the additional 
insured may receive protection as a landlord, an architect working for the insured, or as a leasing company. Additional 
insureds appear only in relation to liability type coverages. 

**additional interest** 

Additional interests appear only in relation to property type coverages. In general, they have a financial interest in a particular 
piece of property. For example, an additional interest may be a mortgagor on a building or a lien holder on a vehicle. 

**additional perils** 

Sometimes called Special Perils, these may include losses caused by aircraft, explosion, earthquake, storm, tempest, flood, 
burst water pipes, riot, strike, civil commotion, or malicious damage. These are extensions that widen the scope of a basic 
insurance policy. Similar extensions may be available for other classes of insurance. 

**additional premium** 

Any premium due to an insurer on an insurance policy over and above the initial premium. Typically, this is a result of 
increased coverage, increased rates, retrospective rate calculations, or a premium audit. 

**adjustable premium** 

A premium that can vary. An insurer retains the right to change the premium or premium rate structure on a class of insureds 
or business during the year. If it does so, then typically, it applies new rates to the new renewal policies. 

**adjuster** 

A person who investigates and assesses claims on behalf of insurers. However, some policyholders can decide to appoint their 
own loss adjuster to assist them in making a claim. If used in connection with marine insurance, then the term means one who 
investigates and apportions general average losses on behalf of ship owners (an average adjuster). 

**agent** 

A person holding an agency agreement with an insurer and who, for reward, carries on the business of arranging contracts of 
insurance as agent for one or more insurers. This agent is an Authorized Representative. Two types of agents sell insurance: 
independent agents, and exclusive or captive agents. Independent agents are self-employed, represent several insurance com-
panies and are paid on commission. Exclusive or captive agents represent only one insurance company and can either work for 
a fixed salary or work on commission. An insurance company that uses exclusive or captive agents is a direct writer. 

**agency bill** 

The billing method used by BillingCenter in which BillingCenter bills the producer for any charges instead of the insured. The 
producer then bills the insured and makes payments to the carrier on an agreed-upon schedule. The structure combines multiple 
policies for billing purposes onto one producer statement that indicates amounts to be paid, minus the commission 
amounts. The producer completes a statement of insurance premiums due and sends it to the policyholder. The producer transmits 
the premium payment (minus commission) to the carrier on one of three bases: item basis, statement basis, or account 
current basis. 

**agency bill plan** 

A set of rules and attributes that specify how to control the agency billing cycle for a specific producer. The agency bill plan 
also includes whether the producer uses the account current or statement bill process. 

**all risk coverage** 

Property insurance covering loss arising from any accidental cause except those that the policy specifically excludes. This is in 
contrast to named perils coverage. 

**Ant** 

Apache Ant is a free build system for Java development. 

**API** 

Application Programmer Interface. 

**as if** 

A term used to describe the recalculation of prior years’ loss experience. It describes what the underwriting results of a proposed 
contract would have been if that contract had been in force during the period in question. 

**asset** 

Balance sheet accounts representing things of value held by the business, including cash, accounts receivable, furniture and 
fixtures. In accounting, debits increase assets and credits decrease assets. 

**assignment engine** 

The Assignment engine handles assignment of business objects to users (claims and activities, for example) by repeatedly asking 
the Rule engine to evaluate assignment rules for the item. Guidewire structures the base configuration assignment rule sets 
in a hierarchical fashion. As the Assignment engine works through assigning an entity, the assignment rules can assign the 
entity first to a location (a particular regional office, for example). It then assigns the entity to a specific group at that office. 
Finally, it assigns the entity to a specific person within the group. 

**audit** 

Insurers commonly review the financial records of their commercial insureds. This is to determine premiums for business 
interruption, workers' compensation, manufacturing, contracting, product liability, and other risks in which the insurer bases 
premiums upon payroll, gross receipts, and other factors. Auditors (employees of the insurer or independent contractors) survey 
insured businesses' records to determine premiums due, based upon expenses and conditions stated in the policy. Typically, 
companies perform audits annually, after the policy period in question expires, and after the company considers the 
audited items to be final. If the audit determines that an insured's initial premium is too low (such as the estimates for audited 
exposures were lower than actuals), the audit results in an additional premium. If the audit shows that the initial premium was 
too high, then the company returns the excess part of the premium to the insured. 

**authentication service plugin** 

Plugin that authenticates a username and password against a remote authentication system. Guidewire provides a default 
implementation that checks user authentication data against the ClaimCenter database. However, you can create a custom 
implementation to use other authentication services such as LDAP directories, for example. 

**authentication source creator plugin** 

Plugin that defines the logic for retrieving user login information from an HTTP request and putting it into a structured credential 
called an Authentication Source. The plugin then returns this to Guidewire ClaimCenter. Guidewire provides a default 
implementation of this plugin that decodes the username and password information sent in a login form. However, Guidewire 
recommends that you create a custom implementations of this plugin if you want other forms of authentication, such as client 
certificates or a single sign-on (SSO) credential. 

## B 

**bastion host** 

A networking term for a network entity that provides a single entrance or exit point to the Internet. Bastion hosts prevent 
cracking of a network by providing a barrier between private and public areas. Typically, you configure a bastion host with a 
firewall to reside in a special network area called the DMZ (De-Militarized Zone). Also, you typically use a bastion host for 
ClaimCenter ISO integration. This is so that you can implement a callback URL from ISO that isolates your ClaimCenter servers 
from the external Internet. You can also use bastion hosts between other Guidewire applications to insulate the application 
from external systems and integration points. 

**batch process** 

A background process that performs important tasks independent of an administrator. All batch processes execute on the batch 
server. A batch process runs to completion and then reports its results back to a log or to the user interface. Examples include 
batch process that send invoices, identify that invoices are overdue, process payments, and pay commissions. 

**batch server** 

If there are multiple application servers in a cluster, exactly one server is designed as the batch server, which is responsible for 
certain operations. For all applications, the batch server manages the Send Queue for messaging and the execution of various 
batch scripts. 

**bean** 

The manner in which Guidewire represents individual objects, such as coverages or vehicles, on a branch. See branch. 

**bill date invoicing** 

A method used by BillingCenter to determine invoice dates during charge invoicing. In bill date invoicing, the relevant invoice 
day specified on the account is used to establish the billing dates for account invoices. For example, the Every Other Week Anchor 
Date setting is used for every other week invoicing. Due dates are then calculated by adding the lead time (specified 
in the associated billing plan) to the bill date. Contrast with due date invoicing. 

**billing instruction** 

A set of directions from the policy administration system (PAS) to BillingCenter specifying a set of charges to be billed. On 
receipt of a billing instruction, BillingCenter uses the payment plan to determine how each charge is to be invoiced. 
BillingCenter then creates invoice items and places them on invoices. 


**billing plan** 

A set of rules and attributes that specify certain aspects of invoice generation, disbursement handling, and payment requests. 
For example, a billing plan specifies the lead time to allow between the billing date and the due date on generated invoices. A 
billing plan is associated with an account. Contrast with term payment plan. 

**billed** 

An invoice status that indicates the invoice has been sent to the account. 

**binder** 

A binder is a general insurance industry term for a written agreement that the carrier provides to the insured. It serves as evidence 
of coverage prior to the insured receiving the printed policy documents. 

**binding** 

The process of turning the offered quote into a contract legally obligating both the client (to pay premium) and the carrier (to 
insure against losses). 

**bodily injury (BI)** 

This commonly refers to third-party injury liabilities. In some cases, it can refer to a particular kind of coverage. At other 
times, it can refer to any injury claim. 

**book value** 

A company's total assets less intangible assets and liabilities, such as debt. A company's book value might be higher or lower 
than its market value. 

**branch (a policy revision)** 

In PolicyCenter, a branch is a graph of objects with a PolicyPeriod entity at the root. The graph collectively represents the 
truth of all effective dates in a contractual period as of the time it was made legally binding. 

**branch ID** 

In PolicyCenter, a branch ID is a foreign key to the PolicyPeriod entity that contains this entity. Guidewire mandates that all 
entities within the same branch share the same BranchID value. This value cannot be null. 

**broker** 

Brokers are similar to independent agents, but typically help with more complicated commercial policies and are more an 
agent for the client than a representative of the carrier. 


**business owners policy or BOP** 

A policy that combines property, liability and business interruption coverages for small to medium sized businesses. Coverage 
is generally cheaper than if purchased through separate insurance policies. The policy typically provides all the coverages that 
a small company would need: liability, property and miscellaneous other coverages such as data or hardware coverages. It may 
also include a business auto component (such as hired auto coverage) but generally not workers’ compensation.
