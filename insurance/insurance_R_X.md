## R 

**rate**

The cost of a unit of insurance, usually per $1,000. Rates are based on historical loss experience for similar risks and may be 
regulated by state insurance offices. 

**rated policy**

An insurance policy that is classified as having a greater-than-average likelihood of loss. It usually is issued with special 
exclusions, a premium rate that is higher than the rate for a standard policy, a reduced face amount, or any combination of 
these. 

**rating**

In PolicyCenter, the process of determining base pricing for an insurance application. It can also be the revised pricing for a 
policy after certain changes, such as adding coverage, reducing coverage, changing deductibles, or any other changes. 

**rating agencies**

Six major credit agencies determine insurers’ financial strength and viability to meet claims obligations. They are A.M. Best 
Co.; Duff and Phelps Inc.; Fitch, Inc.; Moody’s Investors Services; Standard and Poor’s Corp.; and Weiss Ratings, Inc. Factors 
considered include company earnings, capital adequacy, operating leverage, liquidity, investment performance, reinsurance 
programs, and management ability, integrity and experience. A high financial rating is not the same as a high consumer satisfaction 
rating. 

**reciprocity**

The practice in which reinsurances are placed one against another. This is so that a reinsured only places a share of its business 
with reinsurers who are willing to provide shares in their own treaties. This produces an equivalent volume of premium 
income. Reciprocity is normally confined to fire proportional business and is occasionally based on an equivalent profit 
exchange rather than premium income. This is no longer practised in Australia or New Zealand. 

**recovery**

A general term that refers to all forms of recouping some of the indemnity payments made on a claim, this can mean salvage 
and subrogation. 

**reinstatement**

The process by which an insurer puts back into force an insurance policy that has been terminated. Reasons for termination can 
include for nonpayment of premiums. It is one of the jobs in PolicyCenter. 

**reinsurance**

Insurance bought by insurers. A reinsurer assumes part of the risk and part of the premium originally taken by the insurer, 
known as the primary company. Reinsurance effectively increases an insurer's capital and therefore its capacity to sell more 
coverage. The business is global and some of the largest reinsurers are based abroad. Reinsurers have their own reinsurers, 
called retrocessionaires. Reinsurers do not pay policyholder claims. Instead, they reimburse insurers for claims paid. 

**renewals**

The extension of the term of coverage of an expired policy, commonly by replacement with another policy effective on the 
date of expiration of the previous policy. It is one of the jobs in PolicyCenter. 

**renewal processing**

The process of renewing a policy. The goal is to: 1.) Minimize losses through the elimination of policyholders with losses 
exceeding premiums. 2.) Maximize retention of a carrier’s best customers. 3.) Reduce expenses associated with the renewal 
process. 

**renters insurance**

A form of insurance that covers a policyholder’s belongings against perils such as fire, theft, windstorm, hail, explosion, vandalism, 
riots, and others. It provides personal liability coverage for damage the policyholder or dependents cause to third parties. 
It also provides additional living expenses, known as loss-of-use coverage, if a policyholder must move while the 
dwelling is repaired. It also can include coverage for property improvements. Possessions can be covered for their replacement 
cost or the actual cash value that includes depreciation. 

**rescission**

The cancellation or undoing of a contract and restoration of the parties to the position they occupied before the contract. A 
party may ordinarily rescind a contract in cases of fraud, misrepresentation or duress by the other party and, in some cases, 
where a breach renders the contract worthless. 

**reserves**

A company’s best estimate of what it will pay for claims. State regulations require insurance companies to err on the side of 
solvency. They also require them to be conservative in recording expected liabilities for claims that have been reported including 
claims that are not yet known but are statistically predicted. In ClaimCenter, these reserves are set for a specific exposure 
in order to estimate probable future payments. 

**retention**

The amount of risk retained by an insurance company that is not reinsured. 

**revisioning**

How PolicyCenter tracks changes to a graph of objects in a policy through time (both model time and effective time). See: 
model time and effective time. 

**rewrite job**

Policies are rewritten to make the types of changes that cannot be done in a policy change job, to correct significant errors, or 
to make changes to the policy. A rewrite, which can only occur on a canceled policy, effectively ends the first policy and creates 
a new one in its place. For example, a customer requests a workers’ compensation policy. However, when the customer 
receives the policy, he notices many errors: the dates and payroll amounts are incorrect, and the building and location are in the 
wrong state. The customer notifies you, the agent. If you choose to fix the errors using a policy change job, the system would 
send out an addendum, calling out the mistakes in the policy. But because there are so many mistakes in the policy, you decide 
to rewrite the policy which sends out completely new policy documentation. 

**rider**

An attachment to an insurance policy that alters the policy’s coverage or terms. Sometimes known as an endorsement. 

**risk**

Risk is uncertainty concerning loss. Sometimes, companies also use this term to refer to a piece of business or a submission to 
an insurer. 

**risk analysis**

A systematic use of available information to determine how often specified events may occur and the magnitude of their consequences. 


**risk assessment**

The overall process of risk analysis and risk evaluation. 

**risk evaluation**

The process used to determine risk management priorities by comparing the level of risk against predetermined standards, target 
risk levels, or other criteria. 

**risk management**

The culture, processes, and structures that are directed towards the effective management of potential opportunities and 
adverse effects. 

**risk reservation**

In the PolicyCenter default configuration, risk reservation is the process of associating a product and period to a specific producer 
code. If a producer code risk-reserves a product to which you do not have access, then PolicyCenter displays the product 
status on the New Submission screen as Risk Reserved. In addition, PolicyCenter does not permit you to create new submissions 
for that product. 

**RoL**

Rate on Line 

**root object**

Root objects are the main objects to be read or updated by an API. The term root object describes the types of objects (Claim, 
User). The term is sometimes informally applied to the symbol that refers to a root object available to a Gosu template. 

In the context of messaging and messaging events, a root object for an event is the entity instance most associated with the 
event. This might be a small subobject or a larger object graph. 

In the context of messaging and messaging events, a root object for a message is the entity instance most associated with the 
event. This might be a small subobject or a larger object graph. 

By default, the message’s root object is the same as the root object for the event that caused its creation in Event Fired rules. 
This default makes sense in most cases. However, you can override this default for a message. 

Contrast with the term primary entity. 

**rule**

A rule is the short name for a business rule written in Gosu and created within the Guidewire Studio application. It is a single 
decision in the following form: if {some conditions} then {take some action} 

**rule engine**

This is the part of the Guidewire application server that evaluates Gosu rules when the system is running. It uses the rules and 
rule sets created and edited within Guidewire Studio to make automated decisions. 


** rule set**

A rule set is a Guidewire application’s way of combining many individual rules into a useful set to consider as a group. For 
example, in ClaimCenter, the Claim Segmentation rules set contains all of the individual decisions (rules) that determine how 
to categorize a claim. ClaimCenter uses rules by taking some item (in this case, a claim) and running the Claim Segmentation 
rules set against it to make one or more decisions. At various points, each Guidewire application runs different rule sets to 
make decisions. 

## S

**safe order**

See safe-ordered messaging. 

**safe-ordered messages**

Safe ordering is a messaging feature that prevents related messages from sending out of order from each other. This is called 
safe order. Messages are grouped by their related primary object for each messaging destination. For important definitions, see 
primary entity. 

Messages send in creation order with other messages associated with that same primary object for that destination. Any messages 
associated with a primary object for that destination are called safe-ordered messages. The application waits for an 
acknowledgement before processing the next safe-ordered message for that same primary object for that destination. In other 
words, delays or errors for that destination blocks further sending of messages for that same destination for that same primary 
object. 

In ClaimCenter, by default any messages associated with a claim send to each destination ordered by claim. Optionally, if a 
messaging destination sets Contact as its alternative primary entity, messages associated with a contact send grouped by contact 
for each messaging destination and sent in creation order. 

In PolicyCenter, by default messages associated with an account send grouped by account for each messaging destination and 
sent in creation order. Optionally, if a messaging destination sets Contact as its alternative primary entity, messages associated 
with a contact send grouped by contact for each messaging destination and sent in creation order. 

There are PolicyCenter objects that are not associated with a primary entity. For example, User. All messages that are not associated 
with a claim (the primary object) are called non-safe-ordered messages. 

In BillingCenter, there is no default primary entity. However, every messaging destination can set its own alternative primary 
entity to one of several values in the Messaging editor: Account, Producer, PolicyPeriod, or Contact. Messages will group and 
order for each destination by the primary entity for that messaging destination. 

These are safe-ordered messages

There are objects in all applications that are not associated with the primary entity for a particular messaging destination. In all 
applications, messages associated with User and Group objects. For ClaimCenter, a Catastrophe message is typically unassociated 
with a primary entity. All messages that are not associated with a claim (the primary object) are called non-safe-ordered 
messages. 

The Studio user interface sometimes refers to non-safe-ordered messages as messages without primary. 

**salvage**

Damaged property an insurer takes over to reduce its loss after paying a claim. Insurers receive salvage rights over property on 
which they have paid claims, such as badly-damaged cars. Insurers that paid claims on cargoes lost at sea now have the right to 
recover sunken treasures. Salvage charges are the costs associated with recovering that property. 

**schedule**

A list of individual items or groups of items that are covered under one policy or a listing of specific benefits, charges, credits, 
assets or other defined items. 

**self insurance**

The concept of assuming a financial risk oneself, instead of paying an insurance company to take it on. Every policyholder is a 
self-insurer in terms of paying a deductible and co-payments. Large firms often self-insure frequent, small losses such as damage 
to their fleet of vehicles or minor workplace injuries. However, to protect injured employees, state laws set out requirements 
for the assumption of workers compensation programs. Self-insurance also refers to employers who assume all or part 
of the responsibility for paying the health insurance claims of their employees. Firms that self insure for health claims are 
exempt from state insurance laws mandating the illnesses that group health insurers must cover. 

**slice mode**

In PolicyCenter, viewing only a PolicyPeriod object’s subobjects at a specific effective date and hiding entities that are not 
effective at that date. 

**snapshot**

A saved duplicate of a claim taken at the time it was added to ClaimCenter. 

**SOAP protocol**

The web services protocol based on XML and typically implemented across the HTTP protocol. SOAP supports remote APIs 
in a platform-neutral and language-neutral way. Guidewire applications make extensive use of SOAP in its native web services 
features. Refer to http://www.w3.org/TR/soap. 

**split billing**

A method to create a set of two or more receivables associated with a single transaction. For example, binding a workers’ compensation 
policy is a single transaction, but it might insure multiple locations. Further, the insured might want each location to 
be invoiced separately. This requires that the billing system split the total amount due into several invoices, each of which is to 
be tracked separately. Split billing does not relieve the main account holder from responsibility that the account remains in 
good standing. 

**SSL**

Secure Sockets Layer, a specific type of encryption of a data stream. SSL is commonly used to encrypt HTTP connections, 
which are then referred to as HTTPS connections (and HTTPS URLs begin with “https://”). 

**staging table**

A database table used temporarily to prepare data to import into an application’s database. Each application provides a 
table-based import interface for very high volume data import. Staging table import is typically used for large-scale data conversion. 
Used in ClaimCenter and BillingCenter for a variety of types of business data. For PolicyCenter, staging tables are 
only used for loading zone location data, not for administrative data or business data such as policies. 

**statement bill**

A statement produced by BillingCenter for each producer when an agency bill relationship exists between the carrier and the 
producer. The monthly statement provides details of how much the producer expects to pay the carrier for income generated 
from a set of agency bill polices associated with the producer. 

**stop loss**

A provision in an insurance policy that cuts off an insurer’s losses at a given point. In effect, a stop loss agreement guarantees 
the loss ratio of the insurer. 

**Studio**

The integrated development environment (IDE) for Guidewire applications. Use Studio to manage rule sets, Gosu classes, 
PCF pages, workflows, entity types, display keys, plugins, message destinations, and web services. 

**subrogation**

The legal process by which an insurance company, after paying a loss, seeks to recover the amount of the loss from another 
party who is legally liable for it. For example, the carrier pays for repairs for a policyholder's car. It then tries to collect these 
costs from the insurance company of another person who was at fault in the accident. 

**suspense item**

That part of a payment that is reserved for a specific policy before BillingCenter receives the policy details or the related 
charge. 

**suspense payment**

A payment that is recorded in BillingCenter for an account or policy that does not yet exist in BillingCenter. 

**system of record (SOR)**

Particularly used in the context of PolicyCenter, this term indicates which system contains the authoritative copy of a record. 
This can be either PolicyCenter or an external system that the application interfaces with. For example, if PolicyCenter is the 
system of record for a policy revision, then it has the authoritative copy. If PolicyCenter is not SOR, then it can have a copy of 
it, but assumes another system has the authoritative copy. This can be slightly different for various technical or business logic 
reasons. If it is not the SOR during a specific time period for a policy, PolicyCenter checks with the external policy administration 
system to get the most recent policy data. 

## T 

**T-account**

Financial accounts that record a set of transactions and associated line items within the accounting subsystem. BillingCenter 
automatically creates the underlying accounting structure for all accounts and policies including the appropriate T-accounts. 
The term T-account originated from the fact that T-accounts are in the shape of a T. The account name appears at the top, with 
debits on the left and credits on the right. In BillingCenter, the TAccount entity owns the financial transactions related to an 
account. In ClaimCenter, T-accounts are hidden entities used to store rolled-up totals for the transactions on a particular 
ReserveLine or RICoding. Customer configuration code must not directly change data on T-accounts or related entities in 
ClaimCenter. 

**template**

There are two types of templates in any Guidewire application. The first is a Gosu template which is a text file that generates 
text-based output. It is used for generating message payloads to external systems and also for HTTP-based data extraction. 
Gosu templates consist of static text content and blocks of Gosu code that dynamically generates text. The second is a document 
template which provides a document source file such as a Microsoft Word file. It is populated with an application’s data, 
based on specifications of the document template’s template descriptor file. 

**term number**

The number indicates the term of the policy period. This always starts with 1 and then increments by 1 for every renewal or 
rewrite. The built-in PolicyCenter integration with BillingCenter uses the term number instead of the model number to identify 
a policy term. 

**third-party liability**

In a claim, the policyholder is liable to another party for causing harm through negligence or some other fault in an accident. 
The insurance company covers the cost of this liability on behalf of the policyholder up to the coverage limit. The insurance 
company also covers the cost of defending the policyholder in any lawsuits that arise out of a dispute over liability. The key 
issues in this type of claim are whether the policyholder is covered for this type of liability, or the insured is liable for the other 
person's loss. This includes the amount of any loss for compensation. 

**Tomcat**

A free open-source application server and Java web application container provided by the Apache Jakarta project. Tomcat is 
one of several recommended application servers for Guidewire applications. 

**transactions**

In BillingCenter, it is defined as all types of financial changes or movements. 

**trouble tickets**

A process that identifies, tracks, and solves an insured’s complaint. Trouble tickets can be associated with an account (or multiple 
accounts), specific transactions on a policy, and/or producers. Used in BillingCenter. 

**typelist**

A set of values (called typekeys), that represent a finite set of choices for a field. In the web service APIs, typelist values are 
represented as constants within enumeration classes. For example, in the web service APIs, the LossType class contains 
LossType typelist values such as LossType.TC_WC for the Workers Compensation loss type. 

## U 

**umbrella policy**

A type of policy that provides coverage for losses above the limit of an underlying policy or policies such as homeowners and 
auto insurance. While it applies to losses over the dollar amount in the underlying policies, terms of coverage are sometimes 
broader than those of underlying policies. 

**unapplied funds**

A specific type of T-account that contains funds received from an insured for payment but not yet applied to a payment. 

**underwriting**

The process of examining, accepting, or rejecting insurance risks and classifying the ones that are accepted, in order to charge 
appropriate premiums for them. Also the name of the department within an insurance company responsible for making these 
decisions. Corporate underwriting can act as a marketing group defining new insurance offerings, determining how to price 
these offerings, and marketing the new offerings to distribution channels. 

**unearned premium**

The amount of premium remaining after deducting the earned premium from written premium; the portion of a premium representing 
the unexpired part of the policy period. Since coverage has not yet applied to the unexpired period, the insurer has 
not yet earned that portion of the premium. 

## W 

**.war file**

A web archive file used for web application deployment, such as within the Apache Tomcat web application container. Similar 
to .ear files. 

**waiver of subrogation**

Insurers have the right of subrogation. However, they can waive that right through this method. 

**WCIO**

The Workers’ Compensation Insurance Organizations is a voluntary association of statutorily authorized or licensed rating, 
advisory, or data service organizations. It collects workers’ compensation insurance information in one or more states. The 
WCIO is composed of the managers of the various boards and jurisdictions. Their purpose is to provide a forum for the 
exchange of information about workers compensation insurance. The WCIO has developed standards for the electronic transmission 
of information between insurers and rating/advisory organizations. These specifications are available for policy information, 
unit statistical reporting, experience modifications, detailed claim information, and individual case reports. 

**web service**

A software system designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network. Web services define a 
set of operations in WSDL format. At run time, web services use the SOAP protocol typically over the HTTP protocol. Messages 
sent and received through web services are in XML format. Guidewire web services conform to additional WS-I specifications. 


**window mode**

Viewing a PolicyPeriod object’s subobjects; accessing data for all effective dates in that policy period’s start date and end 
date. 

**write-off**

A process that allows BillingCenter to cancel assets held in the charge invoicing T-Accounts, in particular those in anticipation 
of future payments from insureds. A write-off removes from the account balance the (usually very small) amount that the carrier 
does not expect to collect from the insured. It reduces the value of an asset by the amount of the loss. The uncollected 
amount that is written off is recorded as an expense. 

**written premium**

The premium charged by an insurance company for the period of time and coverage provided by an insurance contract. Written 
premium depicts the amount of money placed on the books for the entire policy. Earned premium shows the amount of premium 
that corresponds to the exposure covered over the life of the policy. 

**workers’ compensation or workers’ comp**

A line of business, it covers a company's liability for injuries or illnesses caused by the workplace. Regulated by the state, it is 
required coverage in place of a worker being able to bring a liability claim against the employer through normal legal channels. 
It covers medical and recovery expenses besides wages lost due to the injury. 

**WSS**

WS-Security (Web Services Security) is a communications protocol that provides authentication security for web services. 

**WSDL**

The web services API description language, which describes an API interface for web services, including interface names, 
method names, function arguments, relevant entities (classes), and return values of functions. Any system can use a web service 
if it knows how to follow the definition provided in the WSDL file for each API. Related to XML and SOAP. Refer to the 
World Wide Web Consortium at http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl. 

**XML**

Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a standard that describes complex structured data in a text-based format with strict 
syntax for easy data interchange. For more information, refer to the World Wide Web Consortium at http://www.w3.org/ 
XML.
